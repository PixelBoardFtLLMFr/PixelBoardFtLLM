Both sprite sheet animations depict the same cute blue penguin character and share a similar structure in terms of the number of frames and animation style. However, the key differences may lie in the specific poses and actions depicted, which can affect the perceived motion and emotion presented in each animation.

Based on the observed similarities in character design and animation format, I would rate the similarity between the two sprite sheet animations as ***0.8***.

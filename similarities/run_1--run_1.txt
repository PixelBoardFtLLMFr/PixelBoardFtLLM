Both sprite sheet animations depict the same cute blue penguin character and share a high degree of similarity in terms of their structure and visual elements. They feature the same character poses and movements, maintaining consistent proportions and colors across the frames.

Considering the likeness in the depiction of the character's actions and the overall aesthetics, I would evaluate the similarity at ***1***.

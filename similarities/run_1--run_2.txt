The two sprite sheet animations depict the same cute blue penguin character, but they showcase different actions. 

1. **Motion**: The first sprite sheet appears to depict a walking or waddling motion, characterized by the penguin's legs moving in a sequence that suggests forward movement. The second sprite sheet displays the penguin with its wings raised, indicating a flapping or jumping action, possibly suggesting joy or excitement.

2. **Visual Elements**: Both animations maintain the same character design and color palette, which is consistent and helps reinforce their similarity. However, the body posture and movements differ significantly between the two.

3. **Emotion**: The emotions conveyed through the actions are different. The waddling motion of the first sheet gives a sense of a casual walk, while the flapping or jumping of the second sheet connotes energy or playfulness.

Based on these observations, the similarity of the two sprite sheet animations can be rated as ***0.5***. They share the same character design, but the actions and the corresponding expressions are distinctly different.

We would like to animate a character according to people's emotions. We have
five different animations:
- idle,
- jump,
- sleepy,
- sad,
- wave.

We also have five particles to add to the animation:
- sweat drop,
- heart,
- spark,
- zzz sleeping,
- angry veins.

The detected emotion of people is @EMOTION@, what animation and what particle
do you advise ? Your response should look like this :

ANIMATION;PARTICLE
